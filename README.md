Creating template using flexbox with goal to later build first project based on it.

I will use my knowledge and skills to create flexbox template based on design challenge from The Odin Project: The Landing Page. Once template is complete, I will use it to build upon it my first project. The goal is to create template which can be easily filled with text and images as needed.

This template will also be used to test different JavaScript code.
