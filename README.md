Creating template using flexbox with goal to build first project based on it.

I will use my knowledge and skills to create flexbox template based on design challenge from The Odin Project: The Landing Page. Once template is complete, I will use it to build upon it my first project. The goal is to create template which can be easily filled with text and images as needed.
